# Standardized Experience

Standardized Experience is a test/exam simulation program designed to help students prepare for exams by providing practice questions and a realistic testing environment. This program, developed using Ruby on Rails, aims to simulate the conditions of tests given at schools, universities, colleges, and other educational institutions.

## Key Features

1. Simulates test/exam conditions with different question types and evaluation parameters.
2. Provides a variety of question types, including Open, List, Choice, Veracity, Formula, Table, Match, and Fill.
3. Supports regular and timed test modes, allowing flexibility in test-taking.
4. Evaluates answers based on strictness, order, and shuffling parameters for enhanced accuracy.
5. Encourages daily practice with at least one practice test.

## For me
Restore the file 2ndY1stS_backup to the database you'll connect to. Preferably postgres. Extract the storage folder from https://f004.backblazeb2.com/file/standardized-experience/storage_2ndY1stS_backup.rar into the project's folder.
